/// Simple upgrade policy that requires a `k` out of `n` quorum in order to perform
/// a proposed upgrade.
/// 
/// This policy is created with a call to `quorum_upgrade_policy::new` providing
/// the `UpgradeCap` of the package to be controlled by the policy, the `k` value 
/// (number of votes, quorum to be reached for the upgrade to be allowed) and the list of
/// `address`es allowed to vote. The `address`es provided will receive
/// a `VotingCap` that allows them to vote for a proposed upgrade. 
/// This policy can be created at any point in time during the lifetime of the original 
/// package upgrade cap.
/// The `QuorumUpgradeCap` received from the call to `quorum_upgrade_policy::new` will
/// be used when proposing an upgrade and when authorizing that upgrade.
/// Given that it is created with the original `UpgradeCap`, it is returned to the owner 
/// of that capability, typically the publisher of the original package.
/// That impies the owner of the `UpgradeCap` is the only one that can propose and
/// authorize upgrades.
/// Considering that the `QuorumUpgradeCap` is both `key` and `store` the owner can decide
/// on alternative ways to offer that capability to other parties.
/// As expected, however, the capability should be reasonably protected and secured.
/// 
/// An upgrade is proposed via `quorum_upgrade_policy::propose_upgrade` and saved as
/// a shared object. As such it can be freely accessed. That instance will be used
/// by both voters of the upgrade and the publisher of the upgrade.
/// The proposer of an upgrade provides the digest of the upgrade that is saved with 
/// the proposal. The idea is that the proposer will provide the compilable source code 
/// to all voters, which in turn will verify the digest and, thus, the source code.
/// 
/// Voters can then vote for the upgrade via `quorum_upgrade_policy::vote` providing
/// the `ProposedUpgrade` and their `VotingCap`. 
/// 
/// Once the quorum is reached the proposer can authorize the upgrade. An attempt to
/// authourize an upgrade before the quorum is reached will fail.
/// 
/// Events are emitted to track the main operations on the proposal.
/// A proposed upgrade lifetime is tracked via the 4 events:
/// `UpgradeProposed`, `UpgradeVoted` and `UpgradePerformed` or `UpgradeDestroyed`.
/// 
/// Multiple upgrades can be live at the same time. That is not the expected behavior
/// but there are no restrictions to the number of upgrades open at any point in time.
/// When that happens the first upgrade executed "wins" and subsequent attempt to
/// authorize an upgrade will fail as the version will not match any longer.
/// 
/// Notice:
/// there are several upgrades to this policy that will be provided shortly and will
/// help with the management of the policy:
/// - the ability to restrict the upgrade as with normal packages (e.g. additive only, 
/// dependency only or immutable) and whether to do that via voting or not is being
/// discussed
/// - the ability to transfer `VotingCap` instances to other addresses will likely
/// be controlled by voting and it is an important feature to add
/// - the ability to change the quorum (k) and the list of allowed voters (n) is
/// under consideration
/// - the creation and usage of a `Ballot` to vote for the upgrade is also being
/// discussed. The ballot will be transferable and an easy way to relate to a proposal
