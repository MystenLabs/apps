/// Description:
/// This module defines a Rule which requires a payment on a purchase.
/// The payment amount can be either a fixed amount (min_amount) or a
/// percentage of the purchase price (amount_bp). Or both: the higher
/// of the two is used.
///
/// Configuration:
/// - amount_bp - the percentage of the purchase price to be paid as a
/// fee, denominated in basis points (100_00 = 100%, 1 = 0.01%).
/// - min_amount - the minimum amount to be paid as a fee if the relative
/// amount is lower than this setting.
///
/// Use cases:
/// - Percentage-based Royalty fee for the creator of the NFT.
/// - Fixed commission fee on a trade.
/// - A mix of both: the higher of the two is used.
///
/// Notes:
/// - To use it as a fixed commission set the `amount_bp` to 0 and use the
/// `min_amount` to set the fixed amount.
/// - To use it as a percentage-based fee set the `min_amount` to 0 and use
/// the `amount_bp` to set the percentage.
/// - To use it as a mix of both set the `min_amount` to the min amount
/// acceptable and the `amount_bp` to the percentage of the purchase price.
/// The higher of the two will be used.
