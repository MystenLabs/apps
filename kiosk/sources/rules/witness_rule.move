/// This module implements a Rule that requires a "Proof" witness to be
/// presented on every transfer. The "Proof" witness is a type chosen by
/// the owner of the policy.
///
/// Configuration:
/// - The type to require for every transfer.
///
/// Use Cases:
/// - Can be used to link custom logic to the TransferPolicy via the Witness.
/// - Only allow trading on a certain marketplace.
/// - Require a confirmation in a third party module
/// - Implement a custom requirement on the creator side an link the logic.
