/// Description:
/// This module defines a Rule which forces buyers to put the purchased
/// item into the Kiosk and lock it. The most common use case for the
/// Rule is making sure an item never leaves Kiosks and has policies
/// enforced on every transfer.
///
/// Configuration:
/// - None
///
/// Use cases:
/// - Enforcing policies on every trade
/// - Making sure an item never leaves the Kiosk / certain ecosystem
///
/// Notes:
/// - "locking" mechanic disallows the `kiosk::take` function and forces
/// the owner to use `list` or `list_with_purchase_cap` methods if they
/// wish to move the item somewhere else.
///
